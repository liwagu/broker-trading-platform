  "isin": "US67066G1040",
  "side": "BUY",
  "quantity": 10.00
}
```

## Business Rules

### Buy Orders
- Portfolio must have sufficient buying power
- Initial buying power per portfolio: $5,000.00
- Transaction: `buying_power -= (quantity √ó price)`
- Inventory is increased by purchased quantity

### Sell Orders
- Portfolio must have sufficient inventory
- Transaction: `buying_power += (quantity √ó price)`
- Inventory is decreased by sold quantity

### Order Cancellation
- Only orders with status `CREATED` can be cancelled
- Cancellation reverses all transactions
